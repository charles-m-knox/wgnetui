# wgnetui

A Fyne-based UI for managing wireguard connections.

## Roadmap

- consider setting the peer config to a password multiline entry if it exists
- add a collapse/show for QR code readout
- consider adding a detector/'*' symbol when a device has actually changed
- implement saving/loading arbitrary sqlite db files
- update the landing screen
- use a splash screen
- future: add a tab for pinging other peers, and doing service checks
